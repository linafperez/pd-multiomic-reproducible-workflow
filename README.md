# Genome-resolved multi-omic workflow for Parkinson’s disease
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is increasingly hypothesized to originate in the gut, yet the mechanistic links between microbiome dysbiosis and systemic neurodegeneration remain poorly resolved. This study addresses that gap by performing a genome-resolved multi-omic meta-analysis integrating Mendelian randomization (MR), shotgun metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, 16S rRNA gene profiling, and untargeted metabolomics across European and Latin American cohorts. By reconstructing 356 high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) and linking strain-level microbial activity to host lipid remodeling, the work defines a functional immunometabolic interface connecting gut microbial programs to systemic lipid dysregulation in PD. This repository contains the fully reproducible computational workflow underlying that analysis, organized by omic layer and methodological order, enabling stepwise reprocessing, genome reconstruction, differential profiling, and cross-layer functional integration from raw data to mechanistic interpretation.
